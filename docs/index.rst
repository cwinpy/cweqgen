The CW Equation Generator
=========================

This package generates a range of common equations used by continuous gravitational-wave community.
As well as providing the LaTeX string for the equation, it can evaluate the equations based on
specified values, and create a LaTeX string based on supplied fiducial values.

The current set of equations that is contains are given in :ref:`Equations`.
