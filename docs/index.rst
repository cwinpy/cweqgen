The CW Equation Generator
=========================

This package generates a range of common equations used by `continuous gravitational-wave
<https://www.ligo.org/science/GW-Continuous.php>`_ community. As well as providing the LaTeX string
for the equation, it can evaluate the equations based on specified values, and create a LaTeX string
based on supplied fiducial values.

The current set of equations that the package contains are given in :ref:`Equations`.
